        <p>Welcome to my carefully curated (okay, maybe slightly chaotic) list of things I want to do before I’m too old to remember what I wanted to do!
            This bucket list is my excuse to say “Why not?” to skydiving, “Sure, I’ll try that weird food,” and “Let’s get lost in that random city” —
            all while trying not to trip over my own feet.
        </p>
        <p>It’s basically a permission slip to be spontaneous, a roadmap to unforgettable stories,
            and a gentle reminder that life’s too short to eat boring food or stay in one place for too long.
            I’m aiming to check off adventures that might scare me a little, make me laugh a lot, and maybe embarrass me endlessly
            (because what’s life without some good cringe-worthy moments?).
        </p>
        <p>
            So, whether it’s chasing sunsets, jumping off cliffs, or accidentally becoming a meme, this list is my way of turning “someday”
            into “heck yes, today!” Let’s face it — if I don’t do it now, my future self will probably just remind me that I’m still scared of spiders.
            Time to live loud, laugh harder, and collect stories that will sound way cooler than they actually were!
        </p>
